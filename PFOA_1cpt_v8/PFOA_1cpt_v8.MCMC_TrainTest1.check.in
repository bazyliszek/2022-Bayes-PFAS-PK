# Notes: 
#   SD of 1e-6 is used when a sampled parameter is "fixed"
#   For steady state calculations, t=1e-6 is used because MCSim requires at 
#     least one t > 0.  Additionally, GM of C_0 is set to 1e-30 and its GSD
#     set to 1.01 in order to avoid underflow/infinities.
#   Modified prior to M_ln_Cbgd_sc to account for 20% RSC in background (2/2021)
